				[Intro] <br>
				La-la, la-la, la <br>
				<br>
				[Verse 1] <br>
				Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home (Go home) <br>
				But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own (Uh) <br> 
				Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes (Your ropes) <br> 
				Forever and ever, no more (No more) <br> 
				<br>
				[Pre-Chorus]<br>
				The midnight sky is the road I'm takin' <br>
				Head high up in the clouds (Oh, oh) <br> 
				<br>
				[Chorus]<br>
				I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no <br>
				Don't need to be loved by you (By you) <br>
				Fire in my lungs, can't bite the Devil on my tongue, oh no <br>
				Don't need to be loved by you <br>
				See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby <br> 
				Ooh, you know it's true (Yeah, yeah) <br>
				That I was born to run, <br>
				I don't belong to anyone, oh no <br>
				Don't need to be loved by you (Loved by you) <br>
				<br>
				[Break]<br>
				La-la, la-la, la<br>
